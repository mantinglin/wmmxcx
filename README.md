## Set up the environment

### Install dependencies for React Native

See the *React Native CLI Quickstart* section in this [document](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup/#Installing-dependencies).

Then, inside the project directory, do a `yarn install`.

### Install plateform dependencies 

#### iOS

When in the project directory, do:

```shell
cd ios && pod install
```

and back up to the project root directory.

## Start the application

Now we should able to start up the application, in the project root directory, using `npx react-native run-ios`.
